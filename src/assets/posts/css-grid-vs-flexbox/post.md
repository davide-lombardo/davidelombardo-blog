CSS Grid and Flexbox are two powerful layout tools in CSS, each designed to solve different layout challenges. Understanding when to use each one can improve your web designs and layouts.

## Flexbox: One-Dimensional Layout

Flexbox is best for layouts along a single axis, either horizontal or vertical. Itâ€™s ideal for aligning elements within a container, like navigation bars or simple item lists.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
