Angular Reactive Forms provide a flexible and scalable way to handle form inputs and validation. This approach is ideal for complex forms that require real-time validation and dynamic adjustments.

## Setting Up a Reactive Form

To create a reactive form in Angular, import `ReactiveFormsModule` and create a `FormGroup` instance in your component:

```typescript
import { FormGroup, FormControl } from '@angular/forms';

export class FormComponent {
  form = new FormGroup({
    name: new FormControl(''),
    email: new FormControl('')
  });
}
