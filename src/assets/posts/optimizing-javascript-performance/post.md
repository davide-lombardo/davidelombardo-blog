Optimizing JavaScript code can significantly improve web application performance, making it faster and more responsive. Here are some effective techniques to optimize your JavaScript code.

## Minimize DOM Manipulations

DOM manipulation is resource-intensive. Minimize reflows and repaints by batching DOM updates:

```javascript
const fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  div.textContent = `Item ${i}`;
  fragment.appendChild(div);
}
document.body.appendChild(fragment);
