TypeScript generics provide a way to create reusable components that work with various data types, ensuring both flexibility and type safety. This feature is especially powerful in large applications, where consistent data structures are essential.

## What are Generics?

Generics allow you to define functions, classes, and interfaces that work with various data types while enforcing constraints. A generic type is denoted by a placeholder, like `<T>`, where `T` can be any type specified during usage.

## Implementing a Generic Function

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a generic function to handle lists:

```typescript
function getFirstItem<T>(items: T[]): T {
  return items[0];
}
